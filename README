pan.js adds native-like panning functionality using JavaScript for any element that is bigger than it’s container.
Optimized for iPad, iPhone and desktop browsers.

pan.js measures the element and it’s parent, so make sure you have a width/height for the elements and overflow:hidden for the parent.
See the demo included for a simple implementation.

Browser support: IE7+, FF3+, Opera 10+, Chrome, Safari, iPad and iPhone (and probably more devices as well).

Usage:
Pan( HTMLElement ); // adds panning for the element

Destroy the pan:
var pan = new Pan( HTMLElement ); // adds panning
pan.destroy(); // removes all events
